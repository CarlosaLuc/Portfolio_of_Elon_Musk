          <h2>Early Life</h2>
          <p>I was born in Pretoria, South Africa. From an early age, I showed a strong interest in technology, science, and imagination. I spent much of his childhood reading books—ranging from science fiction to encyclopedias—and teaching myself how things worked.At the age of 12, I developed and sold my first computer game, <a src="https://blastar-1984.appspot.com/">Blastar</a>(You can access the web version by clicking the link), after teaching myself programming on a Commodore VIC-20.</p>

          <br>
          <p>I attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and later Pretoria Boys High School, where I was known more for my quiet intellect than for fitting in socially. At 17, I left South Africa to avoid mandatory military service under apartheid and pursued education abroad, first in Canada at Queen’s University and later transferring to the University of Pennsylvania in the United States.<br><br>These early years built the foundation of my mindset and a vision of the future far larger than my immediate surroundings.</p>
